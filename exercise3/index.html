        <p>what is a website?</p>
        <p>a website is an online location that people can visit and gain information from. in that sense, a website is kind of a like a physical site, but it is not bound by the rules of the physical world. 
        however, it shares many similarities with physical sites. websites are often comprised of multiple pages, such as buildings which have multiple rooms. they are hosted by webhosts which are kind of like landlords who rent out spaces. they have domain names, analogous to street addresses. the design of the website is dictated by html and css which is kind of like architecture and interior design. websites are more "free" than physical sites, however, in that it is easy for anyone to create a website and share information with others.

        <p>why put things on the internet?</p>
        <p>there are many reasons why one might want to put things on the internet. for example, one's motivation could be simply to share information with others in a public space. or, they could be looking to spread their ideas and gain influence. or, they could be intending to sell something. or, they could be showcasing their web design skills to get a job. there are countless more reasons to put things on the internet.</p>
        <p>will websites someday become obsolete?</p>
        <p>i don't think that websites will become obselete in the foreseeable future. unless the experience of "browsing the web" fundamentally changes, websites will always make up the internet. it's difficult to imagine an internet without websites in the same way that it is difficult to a imagine a city without buildings. since i have never had the experience of using the internet without websites, i find it difficult to speculate on whether they will one day be obselete.</p>
        <p>what is your relationship with technology?</p>
        <p>i, along with most of my generation, am inextricably linked with technology. actually, every person on this planet is, in a sense, if you define technology as "the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes", rather than understanding technology only as electronics. every human uses tools to enhance and streamline their lives. </p>
