                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>
                    The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America composed of 30 teams. It is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and is considered the premier professional basketball league in the world.<br>
                    The NBA.com website is not designed for people who are new to the NBA. The website would likely be very confusing for someone who is unexperienced with professional basketball. Since NBA viewership is already so high being one of the premier sports leagues in the world, it is assumed that the user already is knowledgeable about the NBA. It serves a variety of purposes, acting as a hub for NBA fans, with streams for NBA games, merch and ticket sales, news, standings, stats, and more. <br>
                    The homepage is relatively minimal, with the majority of the space occupied by the slideshow featuring relevant news, a stream countdown to the next game, an "NBA mailbag", analysis of possible changes for the next game, and another news piece about how the Celtics are chasing history.

                <h2>CONTENT</h2>
                <p>
                    The content on NBA.com contributes to the site's purpose of acting as a hub for NBA fans. There are no issues with legibility, and the images and media are engaging. Alongside the slideshow shown upon first impression, when the user scrolls down there is more content: Stories, shortform content similar to Instagram stories for those who desire more digestible media, a "Trending Now" section featuring trending storylines during the NBA finals, a section with news conferences with players and coaches, and a sidebar with official NBA social media accounts, a "Social Impact" section, and a "Quick Links" section. <br>
                    While there is nothing out of place with the content presented, there could be a greater emphasis on quality content. Most of the content is in the form of news articles, shortform recaps and highlights, and press conferences. While these are somewhat useful, most NBA fans would look elsewhere for NBA news and recaps, such as Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit. NBA.com should distinguish itself from these sites by highlighting high-effort content from NBA teams' marketing departments.<br>
                    The site could also benefit from adding new ways of engaging fans. I will elaborate on this point further in the following sections.

                    <h2>VISUAL APPEAL/UI</h2>
                    <p>
                        NBA.com suffers from lack of visual appeal. As exemplified in the "Schedule" page on the left, the whole site feels lacking in terms of excitement and energy, which are extremely important in any professional sport. The site feels sterile and utilitarian, and could really use a refresh. The visual design of the website does nothing to reflect what makes the NBA special, which include its diehard fans, intriguing storylines, and unbelieveable moments. <br>
                        While there is visual hierarchy employed to spotlight the "important" items, these are often just news articles and highlights. As seen in the home page, the slideshow takes up almost half the screen with content that is often uninteresting. As a frequent user myself, I almost never click on these. There should be more hierarchy allocated to the features that fans use the site for, like streams of NBA games.

                    <h2>INTERACTIVITY/UX</h2>
                    <p>
                        NBA.com's UX design is okay and mostly serves its purpose of directing you where you need to go. There are no glaring issues with the navigation experience. However, like I mentioned in the previous section, there could be more attention given to visual hierarchy in order to highlight what people usually use the site for, which is NBA streams.<br>
                        Despite not having any glaring issues, the UX of the website feels somewhat hollow. The essence of the NBA, what makes it so fun to watch as a spectator, is completely absent from the user experience of NBA.com. One way to inject energy into the site would be to add a chatbox next to the stream player, taking inspiration from other livestream websites such as Twitch and YouTube. Having a live chat would allow for banter between fans of opposing teams, creating a feeling of excitement and engagement that is currently lacking.
