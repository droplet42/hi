    <p>Orbitting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles
        is an <b>utterly insignificant</b> little blue-green planet whose
        ape-descended life forms are so <b>amazingly primitive</b> that they still
        think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.</p>
    <p>Only six people in the <i>entire Galaxy</i> understood the principle
        on which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once
        Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was
        more or less a <i>fait accompli</i>: he was ideal presidency fodder.</p>
